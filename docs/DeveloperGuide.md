## Product scope
### Target user profile

Forgetful NUS students who used to rely on LumiNUS’s deadline reminders.

### Value proposition

With the transition to Canvas, the most important feature of LumiNUS’s deadline reminders is gone! Our project aims to 
bring an application to keep you aware of your deadlines and not miss them.
