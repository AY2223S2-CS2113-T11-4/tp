## Project: NUS To-Do List

NUS To-Do List is a Java command-line interface (CLI) application that is designed to allow NUS students to keep track
of tasks that needs to be completed.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Summary of Contributions

- New Feature: Created the list command to allow users to list out their ToDos by deadline.
    - What it does: Reads the data file and prints out all the saved tasks to the user.
    - Justification: This feature is essential so that users can see what they have.

- New Feature: Created a findbytag command to allow users to find tasks of a particular tag.
    - What it does: find out all relevant tasks that correspond to the tag.
    - Justification: Students can have a better overview of different tags, for example tagging by module, to have a
      clearer idea of what is needed.

- New Feature: Created a findbypriority command to allow users to find tasks of a priority value.
    - What it does: find out all relevant tasks that correspond to the priority value.
    - Justification: Students can quickly view task that have high priority such that they can prioritize their work
      and finish their work on time.
