## Introduction

With the transition to Canvas, the most important feature of LumiNUSâ€™s deadline reminders is gone! **NUS To-Do List** aims to
bring an application to keep you aware of your deadlines and not miss them.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed.
2. Download the latest version of `NUS To-Do List` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113-T11-4/tp/releases/tag/v2.0).
3. Double-click the downloaded jar file or run `java -jar todolist.jar` in a terminal to start the program.

## Features 

#### Notes about the command format

- **Flags**
  - Words with a dash in front such as `-due` or `-email`, are flags. Hence, parameters like the description or tags cannot start with a dash.
  - Each command has its own flags that need to be provided when running the command.
  - You **cannot** repeat the same flag (`-edit abc -edit def`) for a command.
  - Flags in square brackets `[]` are optional. (Do not include the brackets in the command)
- **Parameters**
  - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters to be supplied by the user.
  - Parameters cannot start with a dash `-`. For example, `add -random_name` is an invalid command.
  - Some parameters have additional restrictions on them; refer to the explanation for each command for more information.
  - Flags and their parameters can be provided in any order after the command name and its parameter. For example, instead of `add DESCRIPTION -due DATE -email ADDRESS` you can also use `add DESCRIPTION -email ADDRESS -due DATE`.
  - Unnecessary parameters for commands/flags that do not need them are ignored. For example, `exit 123` is equivalent to `exit`.
- **Dates**
  - The date-time format is `dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm` or `dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm`. An example of a valid date-time is `14/03/2025 16:40`.
- **Others**
  - Trailing, leading or consecutive spaces will be removed from commands.

### Adding a task `add`

Adds a new task to your To-Do list.

Format: `add DESCRIPTION [-due DEADLINE] [-email EMAIL_ADDRESS] [-tags LIST_OF_TAGS] [-rep REPEAT_DURATION] [-prio PRIORITY_LEVEL]`

- The format for `DEADLINE` is `dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm` or `dd-mm-yyyy hh:mm`, and cannot be in the past.
- `EMAIL_ADDRESS` must be of a valid email address format.
- `LIST_OF_TAGS` can consist of multiple tags, separated by a space. A task cannot have multiple of the same tag. Tags will be sorted in lexicographic order.
- `REPEAT_DURATION` must be an integer from 0 to 2147483647, and can only be used if a `DEADLINE` is also provided. A new task will be added every week starting from the `DEADLINE` for `REPEAT_DURATION` times.
- `PRIORITY_LEVEL` must be either 1, 2, or 3 (1: `Low`, 2: `Medium`, 3: `High`).

Example of usage and output: 

`add todo -due 23/09/3000 23:59` creates a task with the description `todo`, and the deadline `23 Sep 3000 23:59`.
```
Okay, I have added this task:
[ID:1]	[ ][todo][Due: 23 Sep 3000 23:59]
```

`add do math homework -email abc@def.com -tags difficult later` creates a task with the description `do math homework`, email address `abc@def.com`, and the tags `difficult` and `later`.

### View/Edit configurable settings `config`

Displays/edits the current configuration for repeating tasks.

Format: `config` or `config -repfreq REPEAT_FREQUENCY` or `config -chkfreq CHECK_FREQUENCY`

for if any new repeating tasks need to be created.

Please refer to example below.

Example of usage:
`config`
```
Here are the configuration settings for your system:
Repeating tasks every 7 days
Checking for repeating task every: 0 minutes

## FAQ

**How do I transfer my data to another computer?**
- Your task list is saved in the generated `data.json` file, and configs are saved in the `config.json` file.
- Copy these files to the other computer and place them in the same location as the jar file for the program before running it. 

**Why was my recurring task details not updated with the original task?**
- The recurring tasks that are automatically added by the system are not linked to the original task.
- If you wish to change the task details for future recurring tasks, you may edit the latest task added by the system before the current deadline.
